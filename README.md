## A Warning

Algorithms and data structures here are academic in nature, and not (necessarily)
suited for performant applications. They are not guaranteed to be --- and are probably
guaranteed not to be --- concurrency-safe. They have not been benchmarked or necessarily
implemented beautifully or efficiently. If you would like to use these algorithms or
data structures, firstly, thank you; secondly, if you have any suggestions, I would love
to hear from you; thirdly, please do not feel unduly negatively towards an intentionally
feeble effort. After all, the default action of not using a library does not compel you
to import this on anyone's account but your own. 

That said, please feel free to have a browse.
